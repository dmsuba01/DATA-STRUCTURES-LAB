A. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Queue ADT using an integer array of size 5. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The Queue ADT has the following operations:
1.	Enqueue
2.	Dequeue
3.	Peek
4.	Exit
What is the time complexity of each of the operations? 

B. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Circular Queue ADT using an integer array of size 5. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The Queue ADT has the following operations:
1.	Enqueue
2.	Dequeue
3.	Peek
4.	Exit
What is the time complexity of each of the operations? 

C. Write a separate C++ menu-driven program to implement Queue ADT using an integer linked list. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The Queue ADT has the following operations:
1.	Enqueue
2.	Dequeue
3.	Peek
4.	Exit
What is the time complexity of each of the operations?
